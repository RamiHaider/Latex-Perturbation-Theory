### hello world

For a non-ordinary differential equations course a major project, I chose to solve a very scary looking non-linear differential order equation using perturbation method to the 3rd degree. It turned out to be so monstrous that I solved it only to the second-degree, even that turned out to be a hassle. Anywho, I wrote this in LATEX, which is an important skill I believe for anyone writing scientific papers. But perhaps more importantly, this paper demonstrates the importance of using computers to solve these equations -.-.
